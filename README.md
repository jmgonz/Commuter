Description 

An average commuter has to go through crashes, delays, bad drivers, and more. Because of commuting people become stressed and suffer through sitting in their car building more rage and becoming late. Commute + serves the purpose of helping users avoid stressful routes by providing alternative routes when the usersâ€™ heart rate rises to indicate they are stressed. A small portable screen can monitor a user's stress and inform the user of alternative routes where they will not be stuck in traffic under stressful conditions.

Why we do this?

By monitoring commuters' stress and tracking their live location it is possible to provide users with new routes which they can opt to take and reduce their stress levels. Commuters can avoid potentially stressful situations and learn about new routes at the same time. By helping commuters avoid stressful situations during their commute they can experience a better quality of life which can lead to better performance at school or work and improved happiness overall.
